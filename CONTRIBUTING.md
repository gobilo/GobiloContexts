Contributing
------------

GobiloContext is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- __Right now__ as base for your changes use `master` branch,
- Add tests for those changes (please look into `tests/` folder for some examples). This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally,
- Commit your code, but do not mess with `CHANGES.md`,
- __Remember__: when you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as target, otherwise it will be closed.

Running tests
-------------

Make sure that you don't break anything with your changes by running:

```bash
$> phpunit
```
